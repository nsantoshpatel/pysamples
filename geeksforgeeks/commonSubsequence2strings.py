""" 
Given two strings a and b print whether they contain any common subsequence (non empty) or not.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T denoting number of testcases. Each of the next T lines contains two strings a and b.

Output:
Print 1 if they have a common subsequence (non empty) else 0.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10^5
1<= |a|=|b| <=30
a and b consist of uppercase English letters ('A'....'Z')

Example:
Input:
1
ABEF CADE
Output:
1

Explanation:
AE is a subsequence of both the string so the answer is 1
